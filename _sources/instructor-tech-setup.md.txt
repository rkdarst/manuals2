# Instructor technical setup

## Terminal usage

- Move your `.bashrc` and `.gitconfig` files to somewhere else before
  you begin.  You want your environment to match the student's as
  closely as possible. Consider setting `export PS1="\w $ "` in
  terminal (see below for more).

- Create a nice, large shell window with good contrast on the screen.
  Beware of colorized text, such as the red in "git diff".

- Don't clear terminal often (or ever)

## Screen sharing

You have to assume the smallest screen from learners and plan for that.

- Learners have a small screen, and need room for their own terminals
  and web browser open, too.  A big screen or multiple monitors is
  special.
- Make sure the text is more than large enough - people are not just
  reading, but struggling to find the important parts while the.
- Sharing a 1920x1080 screen is not a good idea: you need to make all
  the text size large so that learners can scale it down, but pixels
  are wasted.
- Sharing a single window would be good, but usually you need more
  than one.
- Zoom now has a "share portion of screen" (Screen sharing → Advanced
  → Share a portion of the screen).
- Our latest idea is:
  - Share a vertical part of the screen, for example half of your
    screen.
  - If you have a FullHD 1920x1080 screen, maybe even a smaller
    portion than that.

When streaming/recording: **Never stop sharing a screen, ask someone
else to take it over**.
There is a chance that the view goes to "gallery view" in the
recording or stream, which makes video editing harder or disrupts
learner privacy.

### Screen share examples

These are layouts of the actual screen or portion of screen being
shared:


```{figure} img/instructor-tech-setup/screenshare-fullhd.png
:width: 75%

**S1**: A FullHD 1920x1080 screen shared.
```

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-setup/screenshare-vertical.png
:width: 50%

**S2**: A vertical screen layout shared.  Note the extra shell history at the
top.  The web browser is at the bottom, because the Zoom toolbar can
cover the bottom bit.
```

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-setup/screenshare-jupyter.png
:width: 50%

**S3**: A sort-of GUI (Jupyter) shared vertically.
```

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-setup/screenshare-rsh.png
:width: 75%

**S4**: This isn't a screenshare from CodeRefinery, but may be instructive.
Note the horizontal layout and shell history at the bottom right.
```


### Screen layout: learners

This is how learners can arrange their screen:

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-setup/learner-largescreen.png
:width: 75%

**L1**: Learner with a large screen, Zoom in dual-monitor mode so that the
instructur pictures are not shown.  Screenshare is on the left side,
HackMD at bottom left, terminal and web browser on the right.
```

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-setup/learner-normal.png
:width: 75%

**L2**: A learner with a single large screen (Zoom in "single monitor mode").
Instructor screen share at right, learner stuff at left.
```

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-setup/learner-small.png
:width: 75%

**L3**: A learner with a particularly small screen.  Instructur screenshare at
left, your windows at right.
```

## Screen layout: instructors

This is what the instructor sees on their screen:

```{figure} img/instructor-tech-setup/instructor.png
:width: 75%

**I1**: Vertical instructor setup.  Zoom is sharing a portion of the left
side, the right side is free for following HackMD, chat, etc (but
don't overload yourself).
```



## Terminal history window

Set an easily-viewable prompt.  Colors may be good, or if not have a
newline (don't little minimal color and no spacing between commands,
it is hard to parse what's a command and what's an output.)  The
minimum is `export PS1='\n\w \$ '`.  With color is `export
PS1='\n\[\e[0;36m\]\w \$\[\e[0m\] '`.

### Terminal history for learners

If you are doing live shell work, you will have commands and output
all interleaved, which makes it hard to follow what you actually
typed.  Have a separate window that shows recent commands only,
without output.  Arrange your screen so there is the main window and
the smaller "history" window.  The history window runs the tail
commands and can be used as a reference for what you just did.

Also check the [shell exporter by
sabryr](https://github.com/Sabryr/Teaching-aids), which copies recent
history to a remote server.

**Simple**: The simple way is `PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a"` and then
`tail -f -n0 ~/.bash_history`, but this doesn't capture ssh,
subshells, and only shows the command after it is completed.

**Better yet still simple**: Many Software Carpentry instructors use
[this script](https://github.com/rgaiacs/swc-shell-split-window),
which sets the prompt, splits the terminal window using tmux and displays command history
in the upper panel. Requirement: [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

**Better (bash)**: This prints the output before the command is run,
instead of after.  Tail with `tail -f ~/demos.out`.

```
BASH_LOG=~/demos.out
bash_log_commands () {
    # https://superuser.com/questions/175799
    [ -n "$COMP_LINE" ] && return  # do nothing if completing
    [[ "$PROMPT_COMMAND" =~ "$BASH_COMMAND" ]] && return # don't cause a preexec for $PROMPT_COMMAND
    local this_command=`HISTTIMEFORMAT= history 1 | sed -e "s/^[ ]*[0-9]*[ ]*//"`;
    echo "$this_command" >> "$BASH_LOG"
}
trap 'bash_log_commands' DEBUG
```

**Better (zsh)**: This works like above, with zsh.  Tail with `tail -f
~/demos.out`.

```
preexec() { echo $1 >> ~/demos.out }
```

**Better (fish)**: This works like above, but for fish.  Tail with
`tail -f ~/demos.out`.

```
function cmd_log --on-event fish_preexec ; echo "$argv" >> ~/demos.out  ; end
```

**Better (tmuxp)**: This will save some typing. [TmuxP](https://tmuxp.git-pull.com/) is a Python program (`pip install tmuxp`) that gives you programmable `tmux` sessions. One configuration that works (in this case for `fish` shell):

```yaml
session_name: demo
windows:
  - window_name: demo
    layout: main-horizontal
    options:
      main-pane-height: 7
    panes:
      - shell_command:
          - touch /tmp/demo.history
          - tail -f /tmp/demo.history
      - shell_command:
          - function cmd_log --on-event fish_preexec ; echo "$argv" >> /tmp/demo.history  ; end
```

**Windows PowerShell**: In [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/),
a split can be made by pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+=`. Then, in one of the splits, the following
PowerShell command will start tracking the shell history:
```
Get-Content (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath -Wait
```
Unfortunately, this only shows commands after they have been executed.

**Obselete**: The below commands rely on recording your entire session
using `script`, and then dynamically following the output.  This
allows you to track commands even in subshells/over ssh, but introduce
a lot of other errors in corner cases.  These might work but needs
debugging (there are lots of complexities in extracting out the right
parts).  Note: some of these ignore the first line you type.

```
script -f demos.out

# most general... prompt must end in '$ '.
tail -n 0 -f demos.out | awk '{ if (match($0,/^[^$ ]+ ?[^$ ]*[$][[:cntrl:]0-9m;[]{,10} (.*)/,m)) print m[1] }'

# Prompt format of [username@host]$
tail -n 1 -f demos.out | while read line; do [[ "$line" =~ \]\$\ ([^ ].+)$ ]] && echo  ${BASH_REMATCH[1]}; done

# Standard bash prompt of 'user@host$ ' (less likely to have false positives)
tail -n 0 -f demos.out | awk '{ if (match($0,/^[^@]+@[^$]+[$][^ ]* (.*)/,m)) print m[1] }'

# Prompt is $ ' alone on a line.
tail -n 0 -f demos.out | awk '{ if (match($0,/^[$] (.*)/,m)) print m[1] }'
```

```
# used for the fish shell (note: untested)
tail -f -n 0 ~/fish_history | sed -u -e s'/- cmd:/ \>/'

# used for zsh shell (put this into a script file)
clear >$(tty)
tail -n 0 -f ~/.zsh_history | awk -F\; 'NF!=1{printf("\n%s",$NF)}NF==1{printf("n %s ",$1)}'
```
